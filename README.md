zsh-syntax-highlighting
It’s simply . . . a highlighter. Whilst you’re typing a command, if it is recognized by your shell, it’s highlighted green, otherwise, it’s red. It also gives you hints about syntax errors in your command by highlighting it.

git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting.git ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-syntax-highlighting  

Edit plugins variable in your ~/.zshrc file and add zsh-syntax-highlighting

zsh-autosuggestions
This gives you autocomplete suggestions based on your command history (commands that you’ve entered in the past). This is very useful for your most used commands with a lot of options!

git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-autosuggestions  

Add zsh-autosuggestions to your list of plugins in ~/.zshrc
